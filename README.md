The Adversaries.ps1 script was written when a Skype vulnerability was reported back in 2013.
I emphasize this script alone due to its complexity and urgent need for completiona and rollout.
The script recursed through all of the existing user profiles on a Windows 7/10 machine whether users were currently logged in or not.
Registry keys were also recursed.
Regex queries were used and the results were put into an array.
